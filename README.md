# Implementing from Scratch: Support Vector Machines (SVM)

This projects explains the intuition behind SVM, proves the underlying optimization problem mathematically, develops multiple SVM algorithms all from scratch (with gradient descent, hinge-loss, quadratic loss, RBF kernel), and benchmarks these against their black-box implementation.

You could say the real goal was to prove this picture wrong:

**Please read the Support_vector_machine_implementation.pdf for more details. I have very much enjoyed writing and deriving the mathematical backbone behind this great algorithm :')**
