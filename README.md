# Support_Vector_Machines
This projects explains the intuition behind Support Vector Machine (SVM), the underlying optimization problem, and further employs multiple SVM methodologies to benchmark the models developed from scratch against a black-box reference.

Please read the Report.pdf for more details. I have enjoyed writing and deriving the mathematical backbone behind this great algorithm :')
